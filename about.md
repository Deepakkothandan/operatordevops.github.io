Hello there, my name is Valter Silva!

Well, I'm passionate about a few things in my life! Like the the movie [The Matrix](the-matrix-definition), [Computer Science][computer-science-definition], [Software Engineering][software-engineering-definition] and [DevOps][devops-definition]. I guess I was always fascinated by how computers can change peoples lives for better!

Then one day I was reading the definition of the role [Operator][operator-definition] in the movie:

> The operator is a crewmember on a hovercraft that assists his fellow redpill crewmembers with information on events, resources, and other protection while they are jacked into the Matrix. Typically, operators are natural-born humans who cannot jack in themselves, but have learned to read Matrix code as well as develop substantially advanced programming skills necessary to aid their comrades.

And I thought to myself:

> Why not mix such definition with my DevOps experience? That would be so cool!

And then I did, here it goes:

> An operator devops is an engineer in a company that assists his fellow engineers with information on events, resources, and other protection while they are working into developing multiple systems. Typically, operators are natural for automation, also have learned to read code in production as well as develop substantially advanced programming skills necessary to aid their comrades.

This definition makes a lot of sense to me, in a funny and nerdy way, of course. Thus, the _Operator DevOps_ project was born!
A place where people, processes and tools will be discussed constantly in order to raise awareness about the DevOps culture and how to make it better for all of us. So, be welcome!

PS: I did the logo just by myself using Inkscape and a few hours on Youtube :)
